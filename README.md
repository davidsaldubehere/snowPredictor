# snowPredictor

An Android application designed to predict the chance of a snow day/school closure due to weather.

Client side only: This was the original design to scrape data from accuweather.com without the need of any backend. 
(Future versions https://github.com/davidsaldubehere/snowPredictorCordova use cordova for the front end, and API calls to a Flask backend which uses official weather API's)

Developed using Kivy, and a custom embeded html server to render web technologies through a dynamic web view (Kivy) to support quick development

Custom embeded server modified from https://github.com/manatlan/guy
